## A brief summary.

This is a [React app](https://reactjs.org/) that uses the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to get a list of all the planets in the Star Wars Universe.

## Some commands

- Use `yarn start` to start the app.
- Use `yarn start:mock` to start the app with mocked fixtures instead of real api endpoint.
- Use `yarn storybook` to start storybook server and see available components from the Design System. [...more about storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install)
- Use `yarn build` to build the app for production into the build folder.
